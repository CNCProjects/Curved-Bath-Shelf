Curved-Bath-Shelf
=================

This is a curved bathroom shelf for the Handibot

You can mill this out of .728" or .5" thick plywood. These are common thicknesses found in Home Depot.

There are completed pictures of this project in the Pictures folder.

There is also a Sketchup model with both thinknesses in it so you can mod them from there.

The VCarve files are all setup for the Handibot with the large material jig and a .728 thickness.
